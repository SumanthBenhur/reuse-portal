# reuse-portal

We are yet to come up with a cool name for our project.

But the basic idea behind this is project is to connect all the students(generally hostelite) of a college/ university so that they can sell their stuff like books, cot, study tables etc. to the incoming freshers.

Presently, we have used the whatsapp chat link to help users connect with the sellers. We aim to add chat facility within the project in coming future.
